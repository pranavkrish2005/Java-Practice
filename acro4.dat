As a child, I wanted to play for our National Team or in the National Hockey League.
But then I saw the money you could make in the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball.
I thought, not for nuthin, but even though I like baseball, the problem with Major League Baseball is the Major League Baseball Players Association.
And I'd never consider playing in the National Hockey League or National Football League, since those guys always seem to be getting hurt and needing physical therapy.
